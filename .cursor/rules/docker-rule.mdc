ðŸ§± General Structure
	1.	Always prefer multi-stage builds for smaller image sizes.
	2.	Base images must be explicitly versioned (e.g., node:18-alpine, not node:latest).
	3.	Final image should be as small as possible using Alpine or distroless images where applicable.
	4.	Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files and speed up build context.
