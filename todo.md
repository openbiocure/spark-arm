Thank you for sharing the full `output` log and for your persistence—this is a tough Spark/Docker debugging scenario, and you’ve done all the right things. Let’s break down what’s happening and what you can try next, with a focus on clarity and actionable steps.

---

## What the Log Shows

- **SparkPi job starts, connects to the master, and tries to launch executors on the worker.**
- **Every executor fails with:**  
  `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot find any build directories.`
- **After repeated failures, the application is killed by the master.**

---

## What We Know

- All relevant directories (`/opt/spark/tmp`, `/opt/spark/work`) exist and are writable by UID 1000 (`pi` on host, `spark` in container).
- Environment variables are set correctly (`SPARK_WORKER_DIR`, `SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS`).
- The Spark master and worker are communicating.
- The error is not about permissions, but about Spark not finding its "build directories" for executors.

---

## What This Error Usually Means

This error is almost always about **the executor’s working directory**. In Spark, “build directories” are subdirectories created under the worker’s work directory for each application/executor. If Spark can’t create or find these, it fails.

### Possible Causes (even if everything looks right):

1. **Volume Mounts Are Not Propagating as Expected**
   - Sometimes, Docker volume mounts can behave unexpectedly, especially with user mapping or on ARM/Raspberry Pi.
   - Try running a shell in the worker container and manually creating a file in `/opt/spark/work` and `/opt/spark/tmp` as the `spark` user.

2. **Leftover or Stale Data**
   - Old files or directories with the wrong permissions can cause issues.
   - Try a full cleanup:
     ```bash
     make compose-down
     sudo rm -rf worker-tmp worker-work worker-logs
     make compose-up
     ```

3. **Docker Compose vs. Manual Run**
   - Make sure you are only using `make compose-up` and not mixing with `make test-worker` or manual `docker run` commands.

4. **Spark Version or ARM Compatibility**
   - Some Spark builds or dependencies may not work perfectly on ARM. If you have the option, try running the same setup on an x86 machine to see if the error persists.

5. **Check the Worker Log for More Detail**
   - The error in the client log is generic. The **worker log** (`/opt/spark/logs/`) may have more detail about why it can’t find the build directories.

---

## What to Try Next

### 1. **Manual Directory Test in Worker Container**
```bash
make shell-worker
ls -ld /opt/spark/work /opt/spark/tmp
touch /opt/spark/work/testfile
touch /opt/spark/tmp/testfile
ls -l /opt/spark/work /opt/spark/tmp
```
If these commands fail, there’s a mount or permission issue.

---

### 2. **Check Worker Log**
```bash
docker exec spark-test-worker ls -l /opt/spark/logs
docker exec spark-test-worker tail -n 50 /opt/spark/logs/<latest-worker-log>
```
Look for any lines about directory creation or file system errors.

---

### 3. **Full Clean and Rebuild**
```bash
make compose-down
sudo rm -rf worker-tmp worker-work worker-logs
make clean
make build
make compose-up
```

---

### 4. **Try a Minimal Spark Job**
If you have a custom job, try the built-in SparkPi example only.

---

### 5. **Try on x86 (if possible)**
If you have access to an x86 machine, try the same setup there. If it works, it’s likely an ARM-specific issue.

---

## Final Thoughts

You have done everything right. This is a tricky, low-level Spark-on-Docker issue that sometimes comes down to subtle Docker or file system quirks, especially on ARM.

**If you want, I can help you step-by-step with the worker log, or you can share your repo and I can review the setup in detail.**

**You are very close!** If you want to take a break, that’s totally understandable. If you want to keep going, I’m here to help you get it working.
